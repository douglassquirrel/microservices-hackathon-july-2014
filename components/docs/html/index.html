<h1>Alex2</h1>
  <p>An experimental microservices platform.</p>

  <h2>Infrastructure</h2>

    <h3>Bus</h3>
      <p>
	Accepts facts for publication on specified topics, and notifies
	subscribers about new facts of interest to them.
      </p>

      <p>
	Currently implemented using RabbitMQ. Publish facts using the
	topic exchange <code>alex2</code>. For sample code see
	<a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html">
	  the RabbitMQ topic exchange documentation
        </a>.
      </p>

    <h3>Fact Database</h3>
      <p>
	Contains all facts published on any topic. Queryable by topic,
	timestamp (including most recent facts on a given topic), and
	fact contents.
      </p>

      <p>
	Currently implemented using PostgreSQL.

      <h4>Example SQL<h4>
        <pre><code>
CREATE TABLE facts (topic VARCHAR(255), ts TIMESTAMP, content JSON);
SELECT content FROM facts WHERE ts > '2014-07-26 11:00:00'
                          AND content->>'temp' < 20;
        </pre></code>

  <h2>Core Components</h2>

    <h3>docs</h3>
      <p>
	Contains these HTML documents and runs a simple web server on port
	8000.
      </p>

    <h3>archivist</h3>
      <p>
	Ensures that any fact published on any topic is queryable using the
	fact database.
      </p>

  <h2>Example Components</h2>

  The current example implementation maintains a simple
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">Multiple-User Dungeon</a>.

  <h3>Client</h3>
    The client is a web-based mechanism for users to view data about the
    rooms they visit, try to move between rooms, and see the results of their
    movement.

  <h3>Room Management</h3>
    This component allows users to create rooms with names and descriptions
    and connect them to other rooms.

  <h3>Movement</h3>
    This component receives requests from users to move, decides whether
    they can move or not, and publishes their movement (or failed movement).

  <h3>Overview</h3>
    This component provides updates on all player movements.
